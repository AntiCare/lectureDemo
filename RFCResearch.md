## RFC Research Report 
### RFC (Request for Comments): 
### definition 
An RFC is authored by individuals or groups of engineers and computer scientists in the form of a memorandum describing methods, behaviors, research, or innovations applicable to the working of the Internet and Internet-connected systems. Many RFCs are informational or experimental in nature and are not standards.[1] The RFC system was invented by Steve Crocker in 1969 to help record unofficial notes on the development of ARPANET. In other words, it is some Internet rules and network protocols. Someone organizes the results of these discussions into a unified document. If everyone follows the rules in this document, then, the respective software can communicate with each other.  

### characteristics 
The RFC Editor assigns each RFC a serial number. Once assigned a number and published, an RFC is never rescinded or modified; if the document requires amendments, the authors publish a revised document. Therefore, some RFCs supersede others; the superseded RFCs are said to be deprecated, obsolete, or obsoleted by the superseding RFC. Together, the serialized RFCs compose a continuous historical record of the evolution of Internet standards and practices. The RFC process is documented in RFC 2026 (The Internet Standards Process, Revision 3). 

There are four streams of RFCs: IETF, IRTF, IAB, and independent submission.[2] They are agencies to review and evaluate RFC. Only the IETF creates BCPs and RFCs on the standards track. An independent submission is checked by the IESG for conflicts with IETF work; the quality is assessed by an independent submission editorial board. 

### Obtaining RFCs 
Almost any published RFC can be retrieved via a URL of the form http://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfcXXXX.txt (XXXX is serial number).
