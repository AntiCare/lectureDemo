### Made by Yang Cheng (474340) 20/06/2021
## Product Introduction
This web application is called "Bookshop Manager". Its purpose is to help bookshop
managers manage their book shops. Considering that one manager may have
multiple bookshops, the bookshop supports CRUD (Creating, Reading, Updating
and Deleting bookshop). Whatâ€™s more, the manager can also manage the books in
each shop and support CRUD (Creating, Reading, Updating and Deleting books) .
## Technical overview
As required, I use HTML+css+JS to
complete the front end, use fetchAPI to connect to the backend (transfer data), and
use Springboot for the backend to connect to the MySQL database through JPA
Hibernate.
